# Design Detailed Document
## Index.html
### Development
The template was completed using Activity III's instructions, therefore it was easy to complete. It follows the construction of the header, main body, and footer, which were lately implemented in the rest of the html files. 
The header can be found at the top of the page, containing the tabs to the different pages accesible inside the webpage, the highlighted one in lightblue being active.
The main body contains the initial information that conveys the message and purpose of the webpage, where the user can understand its structure. 
The footer separates the author's contact information into three section, the location, phone number, and email, followed by the copyright and design properties.

### CSS File Section
Utilizes the determined structure given in activity three with some changes in the color scheme and font type. Inside the main body, it utilizes various containers to separate each page section. Additionally, it contains small symbols next to each heading that represent every area for aesthetic purposes.  

### Challenges
Arranging every container to be proportional along with the small symbols to be corresponding to each heading was a challenge at the start, but clearly resolved in the final product. 


## About.html
### Development 
The starting template was taken from activity IV so that it could be easy to understand and follow each page's implementation into the final prototype of the webpage. The body of this page is composed by one main section, one small conaitainer that includes social media profiles, and a main picture of the author. Each small logo is a clickable icon that directs the user to its corresponding social media pofile.
The purpose of this page is for the user to learn a little about the author of the page, along with information that a curriculum should include.

### CSS File Section
The style section of this page is relatively small compared to the others, as it only really includes the main picture and small container. The list style was edited for it to fit correctly into the section, but most of it was predetermined by the instructions in Activity IV.

### Challenges
It was hard to arrange the picture and container of social medias, especially for them to look balanced with the list and prior paragraph.


## Topic.html
### Development
As mentioned before, every secondary page has follows the initial template from Activity IV. However, it also includes summarized information from the topic of the Practical Work I.
The purpose of this page is for the user to understand the main information of Gnerative AI and how it is being implemented in the video game industry.

### CSS File Section
This section is a little more complicated, as it includes side-by-side pictures and containers of different sizes for every piece of information. Nevertheless, it is stll pretty simple as it follows the same structure of the previous pages. 

### Challenges
Making the images be the same size, and for them to be on the same height inside each container was a big challenge, as more knowledge was needed and further research was done to solve this issue.


## Degree
### Development
The creation of this section includes tables, lists, images with links that include the direction of the University's website,text with links to other pages, and flexible containers. 
This page provides the user with the main information about the dual degree in Mathematical and Computer Engineering, which helps to get a further insight inside the purpose of the website and the learning methods of the specific subject of FCE. 

### CSS File Section
This is the most complex section in the document, as it includes the style of flexible conntainers, detailed tables, and had to figure out developed containers which were done following "detail" and "summary" tools. 

### Challenges
This was the hardest page to complete with all the different meassures, styles, and requirements. Adding the different "year" sections was very demanding, as making them fit without disturbing the rest of the information inside the page proved to be a big challenge. Everything became disorganized when each "info-container" was opened, however, it was later fixed wih great dedication, trial-and-error, and research.


## FCE
### Development
This page includes "pop-up" containers that display the information of each module within the course's curriculum once pressed. Moreover, it includes a detailed table with the principal information of the subject, and later more information about was is to be expected and gained from the course. 
The purpose of this page is for the user to discover what the Fundamentals of Computer Engineering course is composed by within the UFV. Its goes in depth about the skills that will be obtained as well as what it is expected to be completed.

### CSS File Section
It merges the styles of the index and degree files, making a continious aesthetic throughout the webpage. 

### Challenges
The main challenge encountered in the development of this page was to be objective with the information that it contains, in order to make it simple yet effective.


## Net.html
### Development
The development of this page is fairly simple within the html file. nevertheless, the icons for each webpage were done sepaetly in Illustrator (an Adobe tool) for it to follow a common aesthetic and look professional. Each icon contains a link which follows the webpage of various classmates' webpages, making it a network in itself.
The purpose of this page, as mentioned before, is to create a type of network, where the user can enter other people's pages and learn more about the course, university, etc.

### CSS File Section
The progress following this section of the styles file contains grids and containers, followed by the scaling of images.

### Challenges
It was very hard to achieve a 2x2 grid, where each possition was filled by a proportional container that included the icon of other people's webpages. To achieve the wanted scaling, gap, proportions, and design, research had to be made, along with multiple trial-and-error opportunities. 


## Contact.html
### Development
This page includes a contact section made with the "form" tool, where each section MUST be filled; the name, last-name, and subject sections ae just text, but the email section MUST contain a valid email and the message section is longer than the rest as it does not follow a basic "input", but a "textarea" code. 
The purpose of this page is for the user to be able to contact the author in case of any doubts, suggestions, or comments.

### CSS File Section
This section of the file contains the style of the form and containers, for them to follow a proportional allignment. 

### Challenges
The most challenging part of this file was for each section of the form to be correctly aligned in order to look aesthetically pleasing. It was very hard to align the name and last-name sections with the rest of the questions.

## Conclusion
This practical work was very useful to really understand each component within an html and a css file, as every time that one repeats a line of code, futher understanding is generated by the maker. It helped to see the actual development and implementation that each line of code had, especially within the css file. This webpage contains multiple "new" concepts within the css file instructions, as it was better for it to follow a designated aesthetic, so that it could not only be visually pleasing, but also professional. 
It was very enjoyable to develop this website, as one could see that every step could become a key piece within it.
